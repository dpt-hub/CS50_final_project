                <h1 class="display-3 fw-normal">About Us</h1>
                <p>Efficiency is the engine of growth. In field sales, the most valuable asset isn’t the vehicle or the fuel—it’s the time your salespeople spend face-to-face with clients. The mission here is to protect that time by eliminating the logistical friction that slows businesses down.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col">
                <p>The "cost of doing business" is often inflated by invisible waste. Hours lost to poor navigation and capital spent on unnecessary mileage act as a constant drain on profit margins. By applying advanced routing logic to everyday sales territories, those "lost" resources are recovered and reinvested back into the company’s bottom line.</p>
                <p>Technology should serve the user, not the other way around. Every feature is built with a focus on field-tested reliability and immediate ease of use. This isn't just about providing a map; it’s about providing a strategic advantage that helps business owners scale their operations, empower their teams, and dominate their markets.</p>

                <h3 class="fs-5">1. Data Sovereignty and Security</h3>
                <p class="text-body-secondary">Client lists and territory data are the lifeblood of a sales organization. Every record is protected with enterprise-grade encryption and stored in secure, world-class data centers. Your proprietary information remains yours alone, never shared, never sold, and always accessible only to authorized users.</p>
            </div>

                <h3 class="fs-5">2. Performance Without Downtime</h3>
                <p class="text-body-secondary">The field doesn't wait for technical glitches. The infrastructure is built for high availability, ensuring that routes are generated and maps are loaded instantly, whether a rep is starting their day at 6:00 AM or finishing a final meeting at dusk. Reliability is a commitment, not an option.</p>

                <h3 class="fs-5">3. Privacy-First Territory Tracking</h3>
                <p class="text-body-secondary">Accountability is essential, but privacy is respected. Tracking features are designed specifically for professional transparency, focusing on mileage accuracy and visit verification. This builds a culture of trust between owners and reps, ensuring the focus remains on results rather than micromanagement.</p>
