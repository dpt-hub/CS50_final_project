# Client Route Optimization Web App (CS50x Final Project)

## Project's Final Goal

My goal with this project is to build an interactive web app that let's users see a map and add client locations to that map. After that, it let's you select multiple clients via markers on the map and make a route to them. 
In the best case scenario, it will have a feature to optimize that route (only 5 clients max.), calculate time savings and be able to import .csv files with client data.

## Self Constraint

For this project I have decided to **only use language official documentation** to code. This means that when facing a coding obstacle I can't use any other search tool (e.g. AI Tools, Google Search, Stack Overflow, Reddit, Coding Forums, ...) besides the official documentation of the languages I'm using. This self imposing decision was made after I felt that I don't check official documentation as much as I should (as you know, it's harder to understand). I also feel that I depend too much on tutorials to solve problems, and, in hindsight, I want to be able to solve them myself. As consequence I know that I will take much longer to get the web app up and running. However, as a side effect of this constraint I'm hoping that, by the end of this project, I will become more acquainted with offical documentation language and a better programmer overall. 

Note: I can use search tools to search for concepts that I don't fully understand (e.g. race conditions, ...). When doing so I will limit my search to websites where code snippets are not usually present like Wikipedia. Also, I can access other language official documentation that are dependent of the current tech stack (e.g. Flask library uses Jinja - I can access Jinja's official documentation).

## Tech Stack

### Front-end

- HTML
- CSS (Bootstrap)
- Javascript 

### Back-end

- SQLite
- Python (Flask, sqlite3)
